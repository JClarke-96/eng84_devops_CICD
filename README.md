# What is CICD
## Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.

## Continous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.
